# Getting Started with Next.js 15

Next.js is a powerful React framework that enables features such as server-side rendering and static site generation. With the release of Next.js 15, there are even more improvements to enjoy. In this guide, we'll explore how to set up a modern web application using Next.js 15 and the App Router.

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework that provides a structure and features for your application:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Renders pages on the server for improved performance and SEO.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pre-renders pages at build time for even better performance.
- **App Router**: A modern routing system introduced in Next.js 13 and improved in Next.js 15.
- **API Routes**: Create API endpoints as part of your Next.js app.
- **Image Optimization**: Automatically optimize images for better performance.

## Setting Up a New Project

To create a new Next.js project, run the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
```

The CLI will prompt you with several questions to customize your project. Here's what I recommend:

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Use ESLint for code quality
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Choose the App Router for modern routing features

After the installation completes, navigate to your project:

```bash
cd my-next-app
```

And start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Understanding the App Router

The App Router introduced in Next.js 13 (and improved in version 15) uses a file-system based routing approach:

- **pages**: Create pages by adding files to the `app` directory
- **layouts**: Share UI between routes with `layout.tsx` files
- **loading states**: Add loading indicators with `loading.tsx`
- **error handling**: Handle errors with `error.tsx`

Here's a simple example of a page component:

```tsx
// app/page.tsx
export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <main className="container mx-auto px-4 py-12">
      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold">Welcome to Next.js 15</h1>
      <p className="mt-4">This is a sample page using the App Router.</p>
    </main>
  );
}
```

## Server Components

In Next.js 15, React Server Components are the default. This means your components run on the server unless specified otherwise. Server Components offer several advantages:

- Reduced client-side JavaScript
- Access to backend resources
- Enhanced security
- Improved initial load performance

To make a component run on the client, add the `'use client'` directive at the top of your file:

```tsx
'use client'

import { useState } from 'react'

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Styling Options

Next.js supports various styling options:

1. **CSS Modules**: Local scoped CSS files
2. **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
3. **CSS-in-JS**: Libraries like styled-components or emotion
4. **Sass/SCSS**: Extended CSS syntax

With Tailwind CSS, you can quickly build modern UIs without writing custom CSS:

```tsx
export default function Card() {
  return (
    <div className="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-md p-6 hover:shadow-lg transition-shadow">
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Card Title</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-600">Card content goes here.</p>
      <button className="mt-4 bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-600 text-white py-2 px-4 rounded">
        Learn More
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Data Fetching

Next.js 15 simplifies data fetching within Server Components:

```tsx
// This component fetches data on the server
async function PostList() {
  const posts = await fetch('https://api.example.com/posts').then(res => res.json());
  
  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map(post => (
        <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

You can also use React's `cache` function or the `revalidatePath` API for advanced data fetching strategies.

## Conclusion

Next.js 15 provides a powerful foundation for building modern web applications. With the App Router, Server Components, and built-in optimizations, it offers an excellent developer experience while ensuring great performance for end users.
