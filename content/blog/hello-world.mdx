Hello, world!

I started Hacky Experiments a while back in the old days of the Pages router (sigh). It was supposed to be a place to share my experiments with the world.

Now, I want to give it a fresh coat of paint and add more features, like a blog and a section for quick demos of new technologies.

Letâ€™s see how it goes.
